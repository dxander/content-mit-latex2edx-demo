\begin{edXproblem}{Matrix expression equality}

This problem demonstrates testing of matrix expression equality.  It properly handles the non-commutativity of matrices.

Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be the usual Pauli matrices,
\bea
     	X &=& \mattwoc{0}{1}{1}{0}
\\ 	Y &=& \mattwoc{0}{-i}{i}{0}
\\ 	Z &=& \mattwoc{1}{0}{0}{-1}
\,.
\eea
Give an expression $M$ equal to $iZ$.

Valid answers include {\tt X*Y} and {\tt -i*Z}.  But {\tt Y*X} is properly graded as being invalid.

% The following code imports matrix_evaluator from the course

% Using the library makes it possible to efficiently re-use code

\begin{edXproblem}{Quantum mechanics ket input}{attempts=1000 weight=10}

Quantum mechanics uses ``ket'' notation like $|\psi\>$ to indicate unit
vectors.

This problem demonstrates how to use customresponse python code to
check for equality of formulas with such ket notation, as well as a
javascript pre-processor to properly format ket expressions.

Type in {\tt (2*|0>+3*|b>)/sqrt(13)} as the answer below.

Multiple correct answer are supported.  {\tt |b>} is also correct, in
this example.

\begin{edXproblem}{Magnitude off hint}{attempts=500}

\begin{edXscript}
ans0 = 177
expected=[ ans0 ]
\end{edXscript}

\edXincludepy{XML/magnitude_hint2.py}

This problem demonstrates the ability to give hints when students
enter numerical answers which are too far from the expected result.

The correct answer is 177.  Try typing in 1 instead (you'll get a hint).

How does the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density}{energy
  density} of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum}{crude oil}
$E_{\rm oil}$ compare with the energy density of hot
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy}{geothermal}
fluid $E_{\rm geo}$?

Model the geothermal fluid as water, and assume its starts at 360 K
when pumped from oil/geothermal wells at a rate of 30 l/s, and is
cooled to 300 K.

Give the ratio of energy densities.

\edXinline{$E_{\rm oil}/E_{\rm geo}$ =} \edXabox{expect="\$ans0" type="numerical"
  tolerance='20\%' inline='1' hintfn="hint_mag0" } 
 
\begin{edXsolution}

  If the geothermal fluid is basically just water, then its density at
  360~K is approximately 1~g/cm$^3$ (really is 0.97~g/cm$^3$ but also
  changes with temperature as heat is extracted). The heat capacity is
  approximately $c = 4.18~kJ/kg K$. If the fluid is cooled to a
  typical temperature of 300~K, then the total energy density of the
  geothermal fluid is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{\rm geo} = \rm(4.18~kJ/kg~K)(60~K) = 251~kJ/kg
\end{equation}
Oil has an energy density of around 43~MJ/kg (wikipedia gives 46
MJ/kg).  Thus, $E_{\rm oil}/E_{\rm geo} \approx 177$, so oil has
nearly 200 times the energy density of the geothermal fluid.

structure splittings, to properly label the following energy level diagram.

\item The fine structure splitting raises the four $2P_{3/2}$ states about
10 GHz above the two $2P_{1/2}$ and two $2S_{1/2}$ states.

\item The Lamb shift raises $2S_{1/2}$ above $2P_{1/2}$ by 1.06 GHz.

\begin{edXproblem}{Graphical input via jsxgraph}{attempts=1000}

The \href{http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/devdata/en/latest/course_data_formats/jsinput.html}{jsinput} framework provides a very convenient way to
employ virtually arbitrary javascript code as a user interface for
input into edX auto-graded problems.  

This is an example which uses sliders and graphs from
\href{http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/}{jsxgraph}, a nice javascript
math function plotting package, as input to a physics problem.

     Identify one such field-independent transition in the figure
     below, by doing the following:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item Use the slider to select a value of $x$
     \item Choose two different states (A...H) for the transition
     \item Click ``Check'' to check your answer
     \end{itemize}
